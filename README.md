# My First NFT Project

This project demonstrates dynamically generating SVG NFTs on Rinkeyby Testnet and the creation of a web client for minting of NFT.

Minting an NFT locally, creating a contract that mints NFTs.
Minting NFTs with Static and Dynamic SVGs.
Setting up of react app and wallet, connecting wallet to web app and creating a button to call contract and Mint NFT.



This project also includes a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
